# Behavioral spec: configuration, environment, deployment

## Behavioral Rules

1. **Operator env var contract.** The operator sets generic `LIGHTSPEED_*` env vars on the sandbox pod template. The sandbox MUST NOT depend on the operator setting any SDK-specific env vars. The operator sets:

    | Env var | Required | Description |
    |---|---|---|
    | `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER` | Yes | Hosting backend: `anthropic`, `vertex`, `openai`, `azure`, `bedrock` |
    | `LIGHTSPEED_MODEL` | Yes | Model identifier (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
    | `LIGHTSPEED_MODEL_PROVIDER` | When provider=`vertex` | Model family on Vertex: `Anthropic`, `Google`, `OpenAI` |
    | `LIGHTSPEED_MODE` | Yes | Workflow step name |
    | `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_URL` | No | Optional API endpoint override |
    | `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_PROJECT` | No | Cloud project ID (Vertex) |
    | `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_REGION` | No | Cloud region (Vertex, Bedrock) |
    | `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_API_VERSION` | No | API version (Azure) |

    Credentials are mounted via `envFrom` (all secret keys as env vars) AND as files at `/var/run/secrets/llm-credentials/`.

2. **Provider configuration mapping.** On startup, the sandbox MUST read the generic env vars from rule 1 and set the SDK-specific env vars required by each provider SDK. This mapping runs before the FastAPI app starts. The mapping logic:

    | `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER` | `LIGHTSPEED_MODEL_PROVIDER` | SDK | SDK env vars set |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | `anthropic` | *(derived)* | `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |
    | `vertex` | `anthropic` | `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`, `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`, `CLOUD_ML_REGION`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` |
    | `vertex` | `google` | `gemini` | `GEMINI_MODEL`, `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` |
    | `vertex` | `openai` | `openai` | `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` |
    | `openai` | *(derived)* | `openai` | `OPENAI_MODEL` |
    | `azure` | *(derived)* | `openai` | `OPENAI_MODEL`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` |
    | `bedrock` | *(derived)* | `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`, `AWS_REGION` |

    `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_URL` MUST be mapped to the SDK-appropriate URL env var when set (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`). `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_PROJECT` and `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_REGION` MUST be mapped to the provider-specific project/region vars. Credential files at `/var/run/secrets/llm-credentials/` MUST be referenced via `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for Vertex providers that require file-based credentials.

3. **Provider selection.** `resolve_sdk()` returns a `ResolvedSDK` whose `name` field selects the backend SDK (`claude`, `gemini`, or `openai`). This is determined by the configuration mapping (rule 2), not by the operator. Unknown values are rejected at startup.

4. **Default provider.** When `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER` is unset, the provider defaults to `anthropic`.

5. **Model resolution.** `LIGHTSPEED_MODEL` is the canonical model input. The provider configuration mapping (rule 2) sets the SDK-specific model var (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, or `OPENAI_MODEL`) from `LIGHTSPEED_MODEL`. SDK-specific model vars MAY also be read directly for backward compatibility when `LIGHTSPEED_MODEL` is unset; if all are unset, use the package default model constant.

6. **Router override.** Callers of the library `build_router` may pass an explicit `model` string; when provided, it overrides environment-based resolution for that router instance.

7. **Skills directory.** `LIGHTSPEED_SKILLS_DIR` sets the filesystem root for skills and provider `cwd`. Default when unset is the container default path under `/app`.

8. **Provider credentials.** API authentication uses the conventional env vars expected by each vendor SDK (Anthropic, Google/Gemini, OpenAI). These are populated from the credentials secret mounted via `envFrom` by the operator, and optionally from the file mount at `/var/run/secrets/llm-credentials/` for file-based credentials. The sandbox configuration mapping (rule 2) sets any additional credential-related env vars (e.g. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path).

9. **Vertex / Google GenAI.** `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` toggles Vertex behavior for the Gemini adapter (tool composition rules per `provider-contract.md`). Set by the configuration mapping when `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER=vertex` and `LIGHTSPEED_MODEL_PROVIDER=Google`.

10. **OpenAI base URL.** `OPENAI_BASE_URL` overrides the OpenAI client base URL when set. Mapped from `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_URL` by the configuration mapping for `openai` and `vertex`/`OpenAI` providers.

11. **Claude via Vertex.** `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` gates Vertex-hosted Claude (consumed by the Claude agent SDK / Claude Code runtime). Set by the configuration mapping when `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER=vertex` and `LIGHTSPEED_MODEL_PROVIDER=Anthropic`. Project and region are mapped from `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_PROJECT` and `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_REGION` to `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` and `CLOUD_ML_REGION`.

12. **Router defaults — `max_turns`.** The router supplies a built-in default maximum turn count to provider options when routes are registered (not exposed on `RunRequest`).

13. **Router defaults — `default_timeout_ms`.** The router supplies a built-in default milliseconds timeout for the run handler when `RunRequest.timeout_ms` is null.

14. **Process entry.** The container process invokes Uvicorn serving the FastAPI app on TCP port `8080` on all interfaces.

15. **Container filesystem layout.** A read-only skills mount path, a writable per-pod workspace path under system temp, and a writable home directory path for the non-root runtime user are provisioned with ownership for that UID. LLM credential files are mounted read-only at `/var/run/secrets/llm-credentials/`.

16. **Python load path.** Runtime sets process environment so application source under `/app` and installed site-packages are on `PYTHONPATH` as defined in the image.

17. **Hermetic / Konflux build inputs.** Release images are built with network isolation after prefetch: per-architecture Python requirements files with hashes, RPM lockfile input, generic binary lockfile for oc/kubectl/ripgrep/dumb-init, and npm lockfile for the Claude Code CLI. Regeneration of those artifacts is via the project automation commands (see implementation notes in `how/provider-architecture.md`).

18. **Non-hermetic fallback.** When prefetch directories are absent, the container build recipe may fetch selected binaries from external URLs for developer builds.

19. **System packages — minimum expectations.** Runtime image includes Bash, Git, OpenShift CLI (`oc`), Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`), ripgrep, Node.js (Claude Code CLI), and supporting OS utilities for debugging and archives per the container recipe.

## Configuration Surface

| `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_PROJECT` | Cloud project ID from operator (see rule 1). |
| `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_REGION` | Cloud region from operator (see rule 1). |
| `LIGHTSPEED_PROVIDER_API_VERSION` | API version from operator (see rule 1). |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_MODEL` | Internal: SDK-specific model vars. Set by configuration mapping (rule 2), not operator. |
| `LIGHTSPEED_SKILLS_DIR` | Skill root and provider working directory default. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude SDK credential (from credentials secret envFrom). |

| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX` | Internal: Vertex-hosted Claude. Set by configuration mapping. |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` | Internal: Bedrock-hosted Claude. Set by configuration mapping. |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | Internal: OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Set by configuration mapping. |
| `/var/run/secrets/llm-credentials/` | LLM credential files mounted by operator (unconditional). |
| `build_router(..., skills_dir=..., model=..., max_turns=..., default_timeout_ms=...)` | Library-level defaults when embedding the router. |

## Constraints

- `RunRequest` does not carry provider name, model, max turns, or budget; changing those requires env vars, router constructor args, or future API extensions.
- Optional Python extras gate which provider SDKs are installed in a given environment; the image recipe installs all extras.
- Bedrock currently assumes Claude SDK. When Bedrock support for other model families is needed, a `modelProvider` field should be added to the `AWSBedrockConfig` CRD (similar to `googleCloudVertex.modelProvider`).

## Planned Changes

- TLS termination, mTLS, and network policies for operator-to-sandbox traffic. [PLANNED: OLS-3038–OLS-3043]
- Konflux pipeline and lockfile policy updates as Red Hat platform requirements evolve. [PLANNED: OLS-2894]
