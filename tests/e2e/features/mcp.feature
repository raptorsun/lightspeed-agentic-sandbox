Feature: MCP server connectivity
  Verifies: OLS-3443 / OLS-3445 (MCP server connectivity for agentic sandbox)
  The sandbox parses LIGHTSPEED_MCP_SERVERS, resolves credentials, connects
  to configured MCP servers, and can invoke MCP-provided tools during a run.

  Background:
    Given the sandbox service is running with MCP servers configured

  Scenario: Sandbox starts successfully with MCP servers configured
    When I GET /health
    Then the HTTP response status code is 200
    And the response body status is ok

  Scenario: Agent can list tools from configured MCP server
    Given an MCP tool listing query has been prepared
    When I POST run with the prepared schema and query
    Then the HTTP response status code is 200
    And success is true
    And the response summary mentions a known mock MCP tool

  Scenario: Agent can invoke an MCP tool and use its output
    Given an MCP tool invocation query has been prepared
    When I POST run with the prepared schema and query
    Then the HTTP response status code is 200
    And success is true
    And the response summary contains known namespace output

  Scenario: Agent handles unknown MCP tool gracefully
    Given an MCP query targeting a nonexistent tool has been prepared
    When I POST run with the prepared schema and query
    Then the HTTP response status code is 200
    And success is false
